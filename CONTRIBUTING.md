# Contributing to PixSieve

Thank you for considering contributing to PixSieve! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zedidence/PixSieve.git
   cd PixSieve
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```

4. **Run tests**

   pytest
   ```

## Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **Ruff** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking (optional, best effort)

Run formatting and linting:
```bash
# Format code
black pixsieve/ tests/

# Check imports
isort pixsieve/ tests/

# Lint
ruff check pixsieve/ tests/

# Type check
mypy pixsieve/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
- Use pytest fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=pixsieve --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scanner.py
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
